```

#### **Frontend**
```html
<!-- Current: Server-side rendering -->
Jinja2==3.1.4             <!-- Template engine -->
<!-- Issues: No build process, vanilla CSS, no component system -->
```

#### **HTTP & Communication**
```python
# Basic but adequate
httpx==0.27.2             # External API calls
python-multipart==0.0.9   # File uploads
