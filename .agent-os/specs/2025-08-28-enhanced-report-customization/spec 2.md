# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Enhanced Report Customization
> Created: 2025-08-28
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement an advanced in-app report editing interface that allows therapists to customize report templates with dynamic sections, drag-and-drop field arrangement, and real-time preview capabilities. This system builds upon the AI Report Writing System to provide granular control over report structure, content formatting, and presentation while maintaining template consistency across the practice.

## User Stories

### Dynamic Template Customization
As a practice administrator, I want to customize report templates with drag-and-drop field arrangement so that I can create practice-specific reporting formats that match our clinical workflow and regulatory requirements.

The administrator accesses the template customization interface, drags field components from a palette, arranges sections in logical order, sets field types (paragraph, multiple choice, dropdown, signature), configures validation rules, and saves custom templates that become available to all practice therapists.

### Real-time Report Editing
As a therapist, I want to edit reports with live preview and dynamic section management so that I can see exactly how the final report will appear while making content and formatting adjustments.

The therapist opens a report in the editing interface, sees a split-screen view with editable form on the left and live preview on the right, adds or removes sections dynamically, formats text with rich editing tools, and sees changes reflected immediately in the preview pane.

### Advanced Field Management
As a practice manager, I want to configure custom field types with validation rules and conditional logic so that I can ensure data quality and create intelligent report forms that adapt based on user input.

The manager defines custom field types (date pickers, dropdown lists, checkboxes, signature fields), sets validation rules (required fields, format restrictions, value ranges), creates conditional logic (show/hide fields based on other selections), and configures field dependencies that automatically populate related information.

## Spec Scope

1. **Drag-and-Drop Template Builder** - Visual template editor with component palette, section management, and real-time arrangement preview
2. **Advanced Field Types** - Rich field type library including signatures, date pickers, dropdown lists, checkboxes, file attachments, and formatted text areas  
3. **Live Preview System** - Split-screen editing interface with instant preview updates, print layout simulation, and mobile responsiveness testing
4. **Conditional Logic Engine** - Field dependency management, show/hide rules, auto-population triggers, and validation chain processing
5. **Template Version Control** - Template history tracking, rollback capabilities, change approval workflows, and multi-user collaboration features

## Out of Scope

- Advanced workflow automation beyond basic conditional logic
- External system integration for template synchronization  
- Multi-language template support
- Advanced reporting analytics and template usage metrics
- Collaborative real-time editing by multiple users simultaneously

## Expected Deliverable

1. Template customization interface allowing drag-and-drop field arrangement with component palette and section management tools
2. Real-time report editing system with split-screen preview, rich text formatting, and dynamic section addition/removal capabilities  
3. Advanced field configuration system supporting custom validation, conditional logic, and intelligent auto-population features
